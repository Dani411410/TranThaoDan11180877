          <p>
            Christopher Nolan is one of the most popular directors in the world, but his greatest successes are his achievements as a writer. His films are cerebral thought experiments and exciting tentpole blockbusters at the same time. 
          </p>

          <img src="/Photos & Videos/nolan-movies.jpg" alt="Nolan's films" class="illustration">
                        
          <p>
            I've been wondering how Nolan manages to strike that balance and I think the answer is that he is phenomenal at story structure.
          </p>
                  
          <p>
            Last year, Batman V Superman attempted to pull off that balance as well. But its main flaw is that it has no structure. If you were bored during the movie, it's because the story doesn't build from scene to scene. At the same time it's clear that the movie wants to trade in big ideas but it seems fine with just injecting them into the movie in the form of TV debates, usually, instead of actually developing those ideas. There is no connection between the alleged themes of the movie and the actions that the characters take. 
          </p>

          <p>
            Let's keep that in mind while we look at a movie that I think has Pitch-Perfect Act Structure: Batman Begins.

              Story structure is all about how scenes are organized into acts, and how each act pushes the story forward. Good story structure will make a story feel propulsive, fast-paced and engaging. As we're about to see, it also provides the framework for how a story discusses theme.

              <strong>But first, what is an act? </strong>

            <p>
              An act is a unit of story that ends when a character makes an irrevocable decision.This decision will set the tone for the next act and usually change the character in a significant way.There's this myth that all stories have a three-act structure, but for now it's important to know that a movie can have as many or as few acts as it needs.
            </p>
                
            <p>Batman Begins has a four act structure. Let's list them.</p>

            <strong>Four corners of opposition</strong> 
          </p>

          <p>
            What makes this a great screenplay is that it is filled with conflict. Internal conflict, external conflict, conflict between morally reprehensible characters. What's more, the conflict is structured in a sophisticated way so that the drama is laser focused on one battle for each act.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            In this film, Bruce Wayne has three primary antagonists: Falcone, Scarecrow, and Ra's Al Ghul.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            This is what John Truby calls "Four-Corner Opposition" in his book <a class="link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Anatomy-Story-Becoming-Master-Storyteller/dp/0865479933" target="_blank">"The Anatomy Of Story"</a>.

                <i>"a simplistic opposition between two characters kills any chance at depth, complexity, or the reality of human life in your story. For that, you need a web of oppositions. … Think of each of the characters – hero and three opponents – as taking a corner of the box, meaning that each is as different from the others as possible.."</i>

          <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
            The idea is that your story basically writes itself when you have four distinct characters in opposition with one another. If a story is just a simple battle of good versus evil the conflict runs itself out pretty quickly. But with multiple levels of conflict, a storyteller has an exponentially greater number of options to explore.
          </p>

          <p>
            In BATMAN BEGINS there are three (3) opponents to BATMAN/BRUCE WAYNE. They are RAS AL GUL, SCARECROW and FALCONE. Each represents a phase in BATMAN’s development. While Batman is altruistic; Ras al Ghul is altruistic but twisted. While Batman is unselfish, Falcone is selfish. While Batman is humane, Scarecrow is inhumane.

          <!--4 corner of opposition in Batman Begins-->
          <p>
            Truby notes these four characters need to oppose each other, like real life. In BATMAN BEGINS Scarecrow and Falcone are at odds with each other over Gotham. Falcone thinks he’s using Ras Al Ghul to win his battle for the city. And Ras Al Gul believes he’s been given a moral directive to end crime with crime.  All of this bothers Batman, who believes the means is just as important as the end.

          <p class="pin-point">
            <strong>The Moral Argument</strong> 
          </p>

          <p>
            But the key to Four-Corner Opposition isn't just that the characters are adversaries to one another,but that their values are also in opposition. And whenever characters with different values clash, we can't help but interpret this as part of the theme. John Truby calls this "The Moral Argument," which I think is a great way to phrase it, as at their core, most stories are an argument about what is moral.
          </p>

          <p>
            The theme of the movie is fear. Each of the four characters has their own highly specific take on the subject. They have different motivations for using fear and they use it against different targets.
          </p>

          <p>
            When designing a story, getting to this point, and contrasting the characters in this way, is a huge milestone, because you have built-in reasons to create conflict between the characters. All of them have at least one reason to oppose all the others. But the real genius of the screenplay is that it uses this intricate moral argument as the fuel for each act in the story.
          </p>

          <!--Act 1-->
          <p>
            <b>ACT ONE</b> sets up everything that Bruce Wayne believes.
            In the first act, Batman trains with Ra's Al Ghul and flashbacks tell us the classic Batman origin story. At the end of the act, Bruce makes the decision not to kill and betrays the League of Shadows.
          </p>

          <!--Act 2-->
          <p>
            In <b>ACT TWO</b>, Batman squares off against Falcone. 
            In the second act, Bruce Wayne returns to Gotham, prepares to become Batman, gathers allies, and makes the decision to take down the crime boss Falcone. The exact midpoint of the movie is punctuated by the reveal of the costume.
            The message we learn is: "Terrorizing the people of Gotham for personal gain is wrong."
          </p>

          <p>
            In <b>ACT THREE</b>, Batman fights Scarecrow. 
            He investigates the whole water vaporizing device, and has a couple of run-ins with the scarecrow. He risks getting caught to save the love of his life.
            The message we learn is "Terrorizing criminals for your own pleasure is wrong."
          </p>

          <p>
            And in the <b>FINAL ACT</b>, Bruce learns Ra's true identity, once again refuses to join him and choose to become the protector of Gotham.
            The message we learn is: "terrorizing the innocent people of Gotham, even for noble reasons, is wrong."
          </p>

          <p>
            All of this affirms the central thesis of the Batman character. That fear should be used against criminals but only as a way to prevent future crime. We learn this basically by the process of elimination. His is the only that survives.

            Now there is no one right way to structure a movie. But there are principles outlined here that, 99 times out of 100, will improve a story. That includes characters making irrevocable decisions that change who they are. And that characters should have contrasting values not just conflicting goals.
          </p>

          <p>
            Batman Begins is probably the most conventional film Christopher Nolan has ever made. All of his movies are intricately structured and incredibly complex, so what I've sketched out here is just the barest bones of his least complicated film. But I think it's useful to look at how a rock-solid story structure can lend weight and nuance to otherwise simple ideas. Batman V Superman might be asking bigger philosophical questions but Nolan's film actually gives    answers.
